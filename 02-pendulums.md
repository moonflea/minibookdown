When a group of people think in the same way, an energetic structure appears. The energetic structure is an **energy pendulum**. The parameters of the group's thought energy become identical. The energy unites into a single current. The *energy pendulum* eventually begins to live its own life, and the group that created it are now subjugated by its laws.

The structure is referrred to as a pendulum because the more people who adhere to its thought energy, the stronger it becomes and the more powerfully it sways.

A pendulum can cease to exist if people stop contributing to its thought energy. Examples of defunct pendulums include ancient pagan religions, stone tools, jump drives, etc.
