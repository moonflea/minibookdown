When a group of people think in the same way, an energetic structure appears. The energetic structure is an **energy pendulum**. The group's thought energy becomes identical. The parameteers of what they think, that is, how much they are capable of pushing the boundaries of what they think, is defined by the pendulums. The energy unites into a single current; the *energy pendulum* eventually begins to live its own life, and the group that created it are now subjugated by its laws.

The structure is referrred to as a pendulum because if/when more people attune to the thought energy/vibration that corresponds with the pendulum, the more powerfully it sways.

A pendulum can cease to exist if people stop contributing to its thought energy. Examples of defunct pendulums include ancient pagan religions, stone tools, jump drives, etc.
