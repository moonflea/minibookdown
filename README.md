# Transurfing Redux

This mini bookdown was written for a Lab Assignment to introduce students to GitHub Actions. It was assigned as part of a Library Juice Academy course about using Git and GitHub for Librarians.

Now being repurposed to summarize *Transurfing* and *Transurfing in 78 Days* by Vadim Zeland. I will be contributing my notes about concepts described in these books sporadically, as my time and desire dictate.
