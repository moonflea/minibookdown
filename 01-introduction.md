# Alternatives Space

*Every theory represents a separate aspect of a multi-faceted reality.*

*Reality manifests itself in an infinite variety of forms.*

The **alternatives space** is an infinite field containing information on all possible scenarios of any event that could ever possibly take place. 

*It serves as a template or coordinate grid for the movement of all matter in time and space.*

Time is static until we look at each frame (instance in time) in sequence.

Countless alternatives of each of our fates exist simultaneously in stasis. 

*Thought energy transforms one of the possible alternatives into physical reality.*

When energy passes through the human body, it is modified by that person's thoughts.

Wheneveer you think about something, be it positive or negative, you are radiating thought energy into the alternatives space. This has the effect of introducing corresponding changes into your life.

The infinity of worlds within worlds exists simultanously.

In Transurfing, wew can choose our happiness; we do not have to fight to get it. Whatever we *order*, our choice is granted unconditionally.
