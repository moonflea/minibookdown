# Alternatives Space

*Every theory represents a separate aspect of a multi-faceted reality.*

*Reality manifests itself in an infinite variety of forms.*

The *alternatives space* is an infinite field containing information on all possible scenarios of any event that could every possibly take place. 

*It serves as a template or coordinate grid for the movement of all matter in time and space.*

Time is static until we look at each frame (instance in time) in sequence.

Countless alternatives of each of our fates exist simultaneously in stasis. 

*Thought energy transforms possible alternatives into physical reality.*
