Pendulums do not care about any particular individual. They only have the goal of receiving energy from their adherents. But there are energetic structures that do not require your energy. One such structure is the **wave of fortune**, a set of cirumstances that are favorable to you personally.

The wave of fortune is composed of a set of life lines that are personally auspicious for you.

The **alternatives space** contains *everything*, including life lines where events of a similar nature are accumulated, and their nature can be a set of fortuitous circumstances that await you.

The wave of fortune is simular to a pendulum in that it has no interest in your fate, but it doesn't need your personal energy the way a pendulum does. Because it does not feed on your energy or anyone else's energy, it eventually fades just like sea waves break upon the shore.

When encountered, the wave of good fortune carries information from other life lines (that exist in the alternatives space). The information resonates as good news. Your task is to grab hold of the wave of good fortune and pull yourself onto the line from which the infornmation originated. Good news and fortuitous circumstances will follow. But it has no interest in you personallly. It will pass you by if you don't take hold of it.

Each one of us can choose happiness and success for ourselves and yet, at the same time, remain restricted by pendulums that lead us away for the wave of fortune. In order to claim our freedom of choice, we must *be independent*. We have the right to be free of other people's pendulums. We simply must claim it.

But how?
