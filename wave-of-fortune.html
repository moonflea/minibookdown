<p>Pendulums do not care about any particular individual. They only have the goal of receiving energy from their followers. But there are energetic structures that do not require your energy. One such structure is the <strong>wave of fortune</strong>. The wave of fortune is made up of a set of cirumstances that is intended to be favorable to you personally.</p>
<p>In other words, the wave of fortune is composed of a set of life lines that are personally auspicious for you.</p>
<p>The <strong>alternatives space</strong> contains <em>everything</em>, including life lines where events of a similar nature are accumulated, and their nature can be a set of fortuitous circumstances that await you.</p>
<p>The wave of fortune is simular to a pendulum in that it has no interest in your fate, but it doesn’t need your personal energy the way a pendulum does. Because it does not feed on your energy or anyone else’s energy, it eventually fades just like sea waves break upon the shore.</p>
<p>When encountered, the wave of good fortune carries information from other life lines (that exist in the alternatives space). The information resonates as good news. Your task is to grab hold of the wave of good fortune and pull yourself onto the line from which the infornmation originated. Good news and fortuitous circumstances will follow. But it has no interest in you personally. It will pass you by if you don’t take hold of it.</p>
<p>Each one of us can choose happiness and success for ourselves and yet, at the same time, remain restricted by pendulums that lead us away from the wave of fortune. In order to claim our freedom of choice, we must <em>be independent</em>. Each of us has the right to be free of other people’s pendulums. We simply must claim it.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>Be different. When your mind is unoccupied, make sure that you train yourself to think positive thoughts. Think about what you want to achieve. Think <strong>only good thoughts</strong> about what you want to achieve and you will achieve it!</p>
<p>Most people fill their minds with uncontrolled negative thoughts. Most people are concerned with what they fear. This makes them prey for destructive pendulums because they radiate energy at the same frequency as the destructive pendulums.</p>
<p>Step by step, let’s change for the better!</p>
<p>First of all, accept your current situation and let go of feeling any dissatisfaction and resentment. Look for things you like. Be grateful for those things. Every single thing in your environment deserves your gratitude and appreciation, even if you intend to get rid of it. When you feel appreciation, you transmit positive energy into the environment. You will find yourself in other spaces where that energy finds you again.</p>
<p>Secondly, start thinking about what you want to have and experience. Think the thoughts that you would have if you were living the life you envision. <strong>Our thoughts always come back to us like a boomerang</strong>.</p>
<p>You have to do two things:
1) make sure you aren’t taking IN negative energy, and
2) make sure you aren’t putting OUT negative energy.</p>
<p>(Caroline’s thoughts: It’s like the Wiccan Rule of 3 – what you put out will return to you 3 x 3 x 3)</p>
